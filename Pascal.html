            <h1 style="font-size:2.4vw;">Who is Blaise Pascal and what did he do?</h1>
            <p style=" font-size: 1.4vw;">Blaise Pascal ( 19 June 1623 – 19 August 1662) was a French mathematician, physicist, inventor, philosopher, and Catholic writer. Pascal's development of probability theory was his most influential contribution to mathematics. Originally applied to gambling, today it is extremely important in economics, especially in actuarial science. Pascal's Traité du triangle arithmétique, written in 1654 but published posthumously in 1665, described a convenient tabular presentation for binomial coefficients which he called the arithmetical triangle, but is now called Pascal's triangle. </p>
            <p style="font-size:  1.6vw;">  The triangle can also be represented: He defined the numbers in the triangle by recursion:                       . In the same treatise, Pascal gave an explicit statement of the principle of mathematical induction.[23] In 1654, he proved Pascal's identity relating the sums of the p-th powers of the first n positive integers for p = 0, 1, 2, ..., k.</p>
