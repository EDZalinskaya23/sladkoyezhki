            <p style=" font-size: 1.5vw;">Hero of Alexandria ( 60 AD) was a Greek mathematician and engineer who was active in his native city of Alexandria in Egypt during the Roman era.
                In mathematics he is mostly remembered for Heron's formula, a way to calculate the area of a triangle using only the lengths of its sides.</p>
            <p style="font-size:  1.3vw;"> Hero described a method, now known as Heron's method, for iteratively computing the square root of a number.[17] Today, however, his name is most closely associated with Heron's formula for finding the area of a triangle from its side lengths. He also devised a method for calculating cube roots.[18] He also designed a shortest path algorithm, that is, given two points A and B on one side of a line, find C a point on the straight line that minimizes AC+BC.
