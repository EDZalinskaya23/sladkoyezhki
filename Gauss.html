            <h1 style="font-size:2.4vw;">Who is Carl Friedrich Gauss and what did he do?</h1>
            <p style=" font-size: 1.4vw;">Carl Friedrich Gauss (born April 30, 1777, Brunswick [Germany]—died February 23, 1855, Göttingen, Hanover) was a German mathematician, generally regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time for his contributions to number theory, geometry, probability theory, geodesy, planetary astronomy, the theory of functions, and potential theory.  </p>
            <p style="font-size:  1.7vw;">Gauss’s first significant discovery, in 1792, was that a regular polygon of 17 sides can be constructed by ruler and compass alone. Its significance lies not in the result but in the proof, which rested on a profound analysis of the factorization of polynomial equations and opened the door to later ideas of Galois theory. </p>
