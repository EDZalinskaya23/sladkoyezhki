            <h1 style="font-size:2.4vw;">Who is Archimedes and what did he do?</h1>
            <p style=" font-size: 1.5vw;">Archimedes of Syracuse( 287 – c. 212 BC) was an Ancient Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, astronomer, and inventor from the ancient city of Syracuse in Sicily.[3] Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity. </p>
            <p style="font-size:  1.4vw;"> Archimedes was able to use indivisibles (a precursor to infinitesimals) in a way that is similar to modern integral calculus.[5] Through proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the method of exhaustion, and he employed it to approximate the areas of figures and the value of π. (consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416)</p>
