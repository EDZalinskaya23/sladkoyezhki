            <p style=" font-size: 1.4vw;">PAdam Ries (17 January 1492 â€“ 30 March 1559) was a German mathematician. He is also known by the name Adam Riese.[1] He is known as the "father of modern calculating" because of his decisive contribution to the recognition that Roman numerals are unpractical and to their replacement by the considerably more practical Arabic numerals.[2] Rechnung auff der linihen (1518): In it, Ries describes calculating on the lines of a calculating board, a kind of abacus. According to the foreword, the second edition was expressly intended for children. </p>
            <p style="font-size:  1.6vw;"> Rechnung auff der linihen und federn... (1522): Besides calculating on the calculating board, he describes numerical calculations with Indian/Arabic digits. The intended readers were the apprentices of businessmen and craftsmen. Until now, it has been published 114 times.</p>
