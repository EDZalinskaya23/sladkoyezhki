            <p style=" font-size: 1.7vw;">Sir Isaac Newton FRS (25 December 1642 â€“ 20 March 1726/27[a]) was an English polymath active as a mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author who was described in his time as a natural philosopher. </p>
            <p style="font-size:  1.6vw;"> Newton developed and used mathematical methods now included in the field of calculus, expressing them in the form of geometric propositions about "vanishingly small" shapes. In a revised conclusion to the Principia, Newton emphasized the empirical nature of the work with the expression Hypotheses non fingo.</p>
