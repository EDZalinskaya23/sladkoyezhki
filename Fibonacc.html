            <h1 style="font-size:2.3vw;">Who is Fibonacci and what did he do?</h1>
            <p style=" font-size: 1.4vw;">Fibonacci (1170 – c. 1240–50),[6] also known as Leonardo Bonacci, Leonardo of Pisa, or Leonardo Bigollo Pisano , was an Italian mathematician from the Republic of Pisa, considered to be "the most talented Western mathematician of the Middle Ages".iber Abaci posed and solved a problem involving the growth of a population of rabbits based on idealized assumptions. The solution, generation by generation, was a sequence of numbers later known as Fibonacci numbers.</p>
            <p style="font-size:  1.6vw;">In the Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. Fibonacci omitted the "0" and first "1" included today and began the sequence with 1, 2, 3, ... . He carried the calculation up to the thirteenth place, the value 233, though another manuscript carries it to the next place, the value 377.[34][35] Fibonacci did not speak about the golden ratio as the limit of the ratio of consecutive numbers in this sequence.</p>
